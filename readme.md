## 🧑‍💼 About Me

I’m a B.Tech graduate passionate about building tools that solve real-world problems using technology.  
With a strong foundation in programming, web development, and cloud technologies, I enjoy combining data, design, and logic to create efficient and user-friendly systems.  

I’ve developed intelligent applications like an ATS score analyzer and a resume chatbot — combining **NLP**, **automation**, and **data visualization**.  
Beyond tech, I take pride in being curious, detail-oriented, and always eager to learn something new.

> 🎯 *Current Focus:* AI-enhanced tools for job seekers, resume analysis systems, and Python-based web apps.
